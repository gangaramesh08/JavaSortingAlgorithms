1. Bubble Sort
-----------------
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts a given array in either ascending or descending order.
The algorithm compares two adjacent elements and swaps them in case they are not in the desired order.
The average and worst case complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2).
