# JavaSortingAlgorithms

1. Bubble Sort
-----------------
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts a given array in either ascending or descending order.
The algorithm compares two adjacent elements and swaps them in case they are not in the desired order.
The average and worst case complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2).

2. Insertion Sort
--------------------
Insertion sort is a simple algorithm that sorts a given array by placing the element at its suitable place.
It is similar to sorting the playing cards.
If you take an element, all the elements to its left would be sorted. The position of each element is shifted until the 
position to place the key element is identified.
The worst case and average case complexity is O(n^2).

3. Selection Sort
--------------------
 Selection sort is a simple algorithm that sorts a given array by repeatedly finding the smallest element amd placing them
 at the proper location. 
 The worst case complexity and average case complexity is O(n^2).
 
 4. Quick Sort
 ----------------
 In quick sort algorithm, we choose a pivot element first. The array is sorted in such a way that all the elements to
 the left of the pivot element would be smaller than it and all the elements to the right of the pivot element would be 
 greater than it.
 The two different sublist thus obtained are then sorted again using quick sort method(recursively).
 The worst case complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2). and average case complexity is O(n log n). 
 
 5. Merge Sort
 ------------------
 Merge Sort makes use of divide and conquer algorithm to sort a given array. The algorithm divides the array into halves
 and further subdivides recursively until no more division can take place. Each divided subarray is then sorted and merged
 The sorted merge continues until the whole array is sorted.
 The worst case, average acse and best case complexity is O(N log N).
