# JavaSortingAlgorithms

1. Bubble Sort
-----------------
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts a given array in either ascending or descending order.
The algorithm compares two adjacent elements and swaps them in case they are not in the desired order.
The average and worst case complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2).

2. Insertion Sort
--------------------
Insertion sort is a simple algorithm that sorts a given array by placing the element at its suitable place.
It is similar to sorting the playing cards.
If you take an element, all the elements to its left would be sorted. The position of each element is shifted until the 
position to place the key element is identified.
The worst case complexity is O(n^2).
